### Extra points. 

This part is not mandatory, but, if you want to add extra points to this exercise you can:

- If you find any issue/bug/error doing these tests and you report us, you will get extra points. 
- If you use any Test Management Tool, such as *Jira, TestRail, Qaseâ€¦* you will get extra points for the effort. 

My answer:

I have no found any issue/bug but I will type the template that I used for bugs:

- Tittle (e.g: Edit a genially > Delete page is not working and error is displayed)
- Pre-conditions (if any)
- Brief description
- Current result (with any screenshot or short video)
- Excepted result (link to requirement or UI design)
- Possible fixes (if any)

I always include a "tag" or "label" to indicate Severity (not priority, this is SM's or team lead's task). I usually use this levels:
- Block
- Major
- Minor
- Trivial
